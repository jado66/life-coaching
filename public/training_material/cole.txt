"so she was asking any advice on thoughts and how to build with your ex again he is avoidant car holder hello native okay so I'm going to talk about that I'm just going to ignore the comments for a second so I can get through this question then I'll go back to the comments after I'm done answering it but so she was asking what are advice and thoughts and how to build with your ex again we'll talk about that and then specifically if they're avoidant so the first thing before you get back together with any ex you have to get your self-esteem and your self-worth and all that really really high because the worst thing you can do is accept someone who's going to treat you like garbage after and that can be really difficult so in some cases it's actually kind of better if your ex takes months to come back because that gives you time to actually work on yourself and build into the kind of person that can only accept what they deserve and not something that they don't deserve so that's what I think about first make sure that you're not accepting things that aren't good and that's actually going to be more attractive too because if people know that you'll accept things that aren't very good then they're just going to give you that you get what you tolerate in relationships so be sure that you've got that first write down exactly what you want in a partner exactly what that would be say I'm only going to accept this and if they're not giving that I wouldn't get back together with them yet if they are then you've got to communicate openly find out what they want too and then yeah I would just start slow by going on dates and stuff and like when you are actually back together I would establish better communication habits like doing that relationship review thing we talk about sometimes in here but specifically if they're avoidant I do think it takes some patience but you've also got to be sure that like do you want to tolerate that avoiding people aren't being avoided or not sharing their feelings because they're mean they're doing it because they're scared but I think definitely establishing that relationship review thing which maybe I'll just talk about that right now too just so everyone knows it who's in here I think that's really really necessary someone is avoiding because if someone's avoidant they can change that's the way they are right now but everyone can become secure and that happens through good experiences of them opening up to you and you respecting what they have to say listening and showing them that it's safe so the relationship review real quick then we'll get into some questions in here so if you're waiting for your question can you be avoided with some people but not with others I'll answer that too so if you want to um have your question answerable answer in one second but first what a relationship review is you sit down with your partner and you say first what you love specifically about them for that week or that month or however often you're doing this really specific so they feel loved and seen then you say on a scale of one to ten how loved do you feel right now in the relationship and then on a scale of one to ten or no then what can I do to make that a 10. okay so when they say anything especially if they accuse you you have to ask them questions and dig deeper into it before becoming defensive because every time you become defensive it's going to reinforce their avoidance and make them not want to share things even more okay Andrew said can you be avoided with some people not others usually if people are avoided they're going to be avoidant with the people that they're closest to just because people who are closer to you are able to hurt you more than people who aren't close to you so yeah usually you can but it's definitely with people who are closer to you all right we'll get into just regular questions here you guys can ask away now I'm looking at them hello militia nice to see you hi Edo Edo Evo eighty okay how long should I do no contact on and avoidant so with with avoided people there's two ways if you feel like they are too shy like they would want to actually reach out to you but they're too shy to do it they're doing because they're shy not because they're avoided but because they're shy and thinks they think that you would reject them then I think it's okay to go about three months and then reach out to them but if they're just doing it because they're avoidant and they're not reaching out to you I would go indefinite no contact because they're showing you that their level of avoidance and their fear of getting close is stronger than their like love for you and even though that like sucks and maybe they do have a lot of love for you if their avoidance is higher than that you're not going to have happy relationship with them they're going to push you away every time you get close okay so Vitor XX yeah I do do one-on-ones so I do the calls around this website it's a link in my bio that is how you get to that so you can just click on it and it's the top one that says like let's make a plan but yeah that's what it is they're 20 they're 20 off right now okay cool so Shadow storm says ex said there was something going on in her rebound and then started talking bad about herself so are you talking to her right now and she's she's telling you that kind of stuff yeah answer that and I'll I'll keep going with yours but I'm gonna do another one while you answer that okay my ex cheated with my friend there they are a couple now but I still love her what should I do Okay so first first thing I would do is you need to see the situation really clearly so I would think about if you have like a younger brother tell the story as if he's in the story and what you would do so let's say your little brother is dating a girl and then he has a best friend and then your little brother it's Girl cheats on him and leaves for the best friend and now they're happy in a relationship what would you tell your little brother to do and like take into account all the good things too like if if your little brother still loves her and all that stuff and is willing to forgive her I think people can be forgiven but that's a tough one so give your little brother your honest advice what you would tell him to do and then follow that no matter how you feel you've got to kind of take yourself out of the situation so you do the best thing for yourself and you can avoid your own anxiety cloud in your judgment so yeah that's what I would do for right now I'd think like that but if she is with like if she's with that friend right now there's nothing you can nothing you can do like to make her like you more like anything I think would be pushing and she'd consider it pushing so I would think like that but for now you've got to focus on yourself and improve your own quality of life I don't think there's and that would make you more attractive to her so that's working towards that goal too if that's your goal but saying anything to try to like ruin their relationship or convince you to come to you I think she would just talk about that with him and it wouldn't be good okay so Shadows from answering said literally a few minutes ago and she said she's going to bed saying stuff like she is toxic all right I would be polite to her and yeah I would be polite to her and just listen for now like obviously she's not having a good time and she's relying on you so I think it is okay to listen for now but if it becomes a pattern that she's relying on you for emotional support without willing to without being willing to be in a relationship with you I would cut it off and say that it's hurting you Chris says do you think my ex putting her stuff on where is it Vince to bio is good she changed it twice since it was about me yeah Chris same same thing when we talked about I do think like if she's still thinking about you and sending you messages on there through that that means you're on her mind which is really good so yeah I do think it's good okay Bandit kid says ex is now with a co-worker after three months of the breakup dated for one and a half months should I move on thank you snow welcome to level 13. I tried to swipe up on the comments and I closed the app but I'm back um Okay so she started dating a co-worker you were together for one and a half months I think I would focus on I I don't think like I would focus on improving yourself and if if like being with her is a good motivation for you to do that like it's keeping you going to the gym and stuff I think that's okay I still think it is I do think that depends how much time you guys spent together when it's a month and a half because that is a short relationship but like some people spend all day every day together for a month and a half and I think you can develop a real connection with that but yeah look into it honestly and see what level of connection you actually did because I do think just generally it is possible for someone to move on in three months after you're together for a month and a half you know so be honest and see like what kind of connection you guys actually have and see if if that connection is deep enough that it should be in a rebound now instead and that I think is what I think about um if you should move on or not but also no matter what like she's feeling I do think that there's no downside to moving on because worst case scenario you see the you see it like she doesn't come back and you end up happier and best case scenario she does come back and you are like more detached and can act logically in the situation and only take her back if she really is willing to um do things Elena says ex posted picture of kissing with girl I was trying to get with should I unad her so I was trying to get with so were you trying to get with the girl now like I don't I don't totally know what you mean so you broke up with someone and then you wanted to be with someone else but then she was with that other person that you wanted to be with after yeah like if you already want to be with someone else and you don't want to be with your ex I think totally unatting him doesn't make a difference yeah yeah I would not matter for sure it sounds like it's just making you sad and doesn't have any like benefits do you think you'll try to come back if he's texted me he missed me and I told him I was surprised definitely a good sign like if they tell you they missed you are you guys still talking like did that turn into a conversation but yeah if people are saying they miss you then they have feelings for you still so that's awesome and I think it's good that you replied like I don't agree with people when they like just try to ignore the ex when they do want them back if you don't want them back then by all means ignore them but if you do want them back it doesn't make any sense to ignore them okay Avery said I've been with him for two years he broke up with me on Valentine's and blocked me dang that sucks that happened I got like divorced on Valentine's Day two or like the same okay I'm relapsing again please help you're doing great and then either you get a text from your ex or you see something like they deleted pictures or you see that they're dating someone else or any of that and it feels like you're all the way back to Step One Like You made no progress this is what I think you should do first you should write down well one thing I think you could do to set up it best if you just barely got broken up with that's probably going to happen to you so what I would do right now is make a video of yourself being completely clear about how the Situation's going like tell yourself how bad it hurts say how bad everything sucks and literally record that and then keep it so if you if you do that then when this happens to you you can watch that and actually see the difference like in how you feel now because in reality most people don't go back all the way to the beginning it just they go back to feeling bad so if you can see where the beginning actually was it really helps so that's one thing I would do to kind of prepare for that if you didn't do that and now that's happening to you try your best to think back to it and also try your best to think about all the good things you have done like if you've gone to the gym for two months that's not stuff that just disappears because you're sad one day like that's actual progress that you've made your body probably change you probably got healthier like give yourself credit for all those things and tell yourself that you're proud of yourself for all those things you're not back to square one if you've been making good progress then all that progress doesn't disappear it comes in waves but your upward trajectory is what matters okay I'm really really upset and super sad I'm Sorry by the way also user797 all those numbers you can go on the Discord which is a link in my bio if you're not in there yet talk to people in there there's people there's about 900 people in there that are um that are all like going through the same stuff you will and they'll support you okay Igor says oh and on her Facebook profile on our profile picture she's wearing a t-shirt I bought her okay I want to ask girls on this one because I've heard from both and I'm not really sure what the answer is here girls in the chat on um if you break up with someone and then you're wearing clothes they bought you or like a bracelet or a necklace does it mean anything like if you post a picture and it's it's closed that they bought you does it mean anything to you guys please answer okay this girl says no I've had girls say yes and no that's what I wanted to see so just Angie says no Florence says it depends depends depends um yes it does Jocelyn says yes okay Jocelyn says yes that's interesting clothes no jewelry yes Alex not really Avery yes um snow says yes okay for all the people saying it depends what does it depend on why why like what does it depend when does it matter necklace yes um if you're like 20 years old and naive then yes is what just Angie says blue eyes says yes um Vanita Prince this is about if if a girl breaks up with someone and she's wearing clothes that used to be the guys or like that the guy gave her like gifts or necklaces or things like that it doesn't mean anything does it mean you still care for the person [Music] um okay so Emma says I have a bracelet I wear but I put it away to detach from it at first anything from then means something if you wear it midi says no I don't think about it at all um simply Skywalker says depends on if it's shoes you love you just like to wear if it's sentimental the necklace then yeah like if you still have them on socials for them to easily see it then yes okay that's that's one I think for you Igor that like it's a profile picture I think that would mean more um I'm almost 30 I don't do stuff like that I have closely by me doesn't mean anything if it if it signifies an event or an anniversary then yes so Igor said I got it for her for the holidays he's trying to see if it means anything my ex has a shirt with my name on it it doesn't mean anything but it's disrespectful if you have someone new um okay cool if it's sentimental then yes is what Jocelyn says so yeah I I guess Igor if it if you got it and it represents like a memory or any of that then it looks like our panel of Judges thinks it does mean something but if it doesn't and it's just random so jewelry necklaces and stuff that is more sentimental yes with a shirt for the holidays you got to think of it's tied to like an important memory I guess that would that's kind of what I get from what they said that if it's sentimental and she would remember certain Memories by wearing it so all right we're gonna do this one so how do you know if you're ready to date again couple things number one I have a couple things that if you're still doing I would not start dating again if you're still checking their social media every day I wouldn't and if they're on your mind all the time I wouldn't and if you can't figure out what you did wrong in the relationship and you haven't made any changes I wouldn't those are three things I wouldn't if they cross your mind every once in a while hey cam then that's fine like you don't have to be completely like a robot and over every single piece of feeling to start dating someone else I don't think that's possible I don't think that's necessary or possible probably thank you Cam um so yeah if you're at a point where you don't check their social media you're not like addicted to them anymore and usually I think like three months is just how long it took me to get there um and a lot of people that I've talked to too then then I would start going on dates of people I wouldn't start like looking for a relationship but like if if your dates go super well and you're actually feeling like that you're not all the way over them but you like aren't addicted to them anymore and something awesome comes your way I wouldn't shoot it down and get rid of it either like don't destroy good things because of your past that's what I would do all right if the relationship was toxic and you no longer trust me should I still hope for reconciliation okay this is really interesting so if the relationship was toxic what are you hoping for reconciliation for that's that's what I'd think about like if you get back together like why is it not going to be toxic again and if it's toxic why would you want to be in it I would think about those things you're not weird like pretty much everyone who leaves a toxic relationship wants it back and part of it is because a big reason relationships are toxic or they have a ton of anxiety in them and they're kind of like a roller coaster of it's really good sometimes and really bad sometimes so you get addicted to those highs and you just want it back because it feels great so yeah think about that like if it's toxic hey Jesse if it's toxic why do you want to be in it now and the answer should be you shouldn't unless things change but if things are going to change what specifically has to change what happens to change for you first so you can have a plan of what you're going to actually like um how do you know when no contact is working on the person who wanted to break up okay Chris I'll answer that right after this one so you got to know what what you would change first you have a plan of moving forward but also you need to figure out what you would have then change and if they come back and they haven't changed that then you should not get back together with them because it's going to lead to the same thing again and you're really sad now like think about how sad you are right now if you got back together with someone who didn't change at all then you'd be right back on my page when they break up with you again foreign yeah I didn't know when no contest is working on the person that is the dumper you you kind of look for those signs that I talk about in the stages videos so the more they like talk to your friends or your family the more they actually look at your stories and things like that when they're showing that they're curious that's how you can like see that it's working on them it's just those kinds of signs that are in those videos and it's kind of crazy because they're actually like really [Music] um okay this is a good one I'll answer that one too um more room for activities so yeah okay yeah that's what I have to say on that one Chris I'd look for those those kind of signs of what it's doing but I do think that like her doing all that stuff with messaging changing her bio and stuff that counts as one of those signs all right so um more room for activity says do they really all come back I feel like this one isn't I do not think that they all come back at all I think that everyone who says that is a liar like they don't people make decisions like it's empirically you can look at a group of 100 people that break up and like half of the people won't come back so yeah definitely not they don't all come back what I try to do is put you in the best position that you can make how do you be okay if they don't come back that's a good question Florence um you can make yourself be in the best position and avoid the like common mistakes that make it make it less likely by going no contact by not bugging the heck out of them and letting them actually think about like their decision but the only thing you can control is how much you grow from the breakup so that's the best thing you can focus on if you focus too much on them and what they're doing then you end up just kind of getting paralyzed and you miss out on the awesome opportunity to learn more about psychology and relationships and get stronger at the gym and make new friends and all that kind of stuff so that's what you need to focus on and by focusing on that you put yourself in the best position to get them back and keep them if they are some of the ones that come back okay so how do you be okay if they don't come back Florence asked you do those same kind of things thank you for the dumbbell Emma you do those same things because if you do what I just said and you end up going to the gym you figure out what went wrong in the relationship and you like increase your self-esteem by going to therapy and changing your life so that you you enjoy being you instead of like I know a lot of people hate being themselves if you change your life so that you enjoy being you that's how you're okay if they don't come back because like you fixed your life you love it now so if they don't come back they're missing out on an awesome life and you'll find someone else who comes into the life and it's awesome and they'll be lucky to be with you because not that many people do that not that many people ever figure themselves out or are able to communicate well and become great at relationships so anyone you're with in the future is really really lucky so yeah that's what I think on that but I think that because I've done it both ways I did one where I just waited and suffered and then started dating someone else before I fully healed and I ended up not making personal progress and ended for a similar reason the first one ended then the second time I was like okay these are the things that were really bad I'm gonna go to therapy now I'm going to move to somewhere I've always wanted to live I'm gonna get lots of friends I'm gonna go on trips I'm going to start a company that I've wanted to start um and yeah changing the start Jujitsu changing the things and doing like living a life that I wanted to live more is the reason I've been able to be okay if you don't change your own life and you just focus on what they're doing then you're totally at their mercy and they get to decide if you're happy or not thank you snow so yeah all right Jake over 97 says what if they read your messages but only respond on the holidays probably means that they still like care enough to keep you around but not enough to like be with you yet so I would if you're sending lots of messages and they're just reading them I would not send them anymore because one of the good things about no contact that makes people come back is they're not sure if they can get back together with you or not but if you're texting them all the time and and like keep texting him even though all they're doing is reading them yeah five months if all they're doing is reading them and they that's enough for you to hang around they're not going to worry about maybe they won't be able to get you back so they'll have no need or drive or motivation um she's shy and dismissive still if you're if you're the only one messaging and she's reading then she has the proof that you're there for her so if she's shy I think she would still reach out because she knows that you're there for her a little bit of that has to fade so that she can like have something to work for and motivation to do anything so why does it feel harder to get over a short-lived relationship than a long-term one if that's necessarily true um yeah I'd have to know more about your like yeah I wouldn't Jay Cobra um I I don't I don't think that's always true like I think that would probably have to do more with your specific situation like maybe you got closer with the short person which you definitely can like there's people that are in Long relationships that only talk to each other like once a week and never get really close and you could be with someone short and talk to them all day and get really close so yeah I think it depends more on that um how would I word it if they asked to be friends that's a good question first um by the way on patreon every Friday I give away a free call so this week Daisy won it and we're gonna work out a free call um um next week but if you guys want a free call or yeah if you just can't afford it yet the patreon's only six bucks and there's I think there's 12 people in there right now so you haven't got a chance of winning it and also if you would like to talk there's 20 off on on there on my website both of these links are in my bio and also the patreon I make longer videos that I think I work really hard on and I think they're better than what I can do on Tick Tock so um you'll get access to those too cool all right so oh yeah how would I word if they want to be friends okay so I'm glad that you don't just want to be friends with them because every person I've ever talked to that I have seen solitary rain I'll answer this one um after so so if they ask you to be friends every single person I've ever talked to which probably on calls is around like 300 now over the last I started in May I think I've done about close probably 300 or a little over 300 one-on-one calls and a lot of people try to be friends I've never seen it work like not even one time like if you're being friends with them most the time what happens is either they believe you and assume that you are their friend and then eventually your feelings build up and you explode love all over them and like are like I love you and they're like what the heck you lied to me then so that's what happens a lot of the time the other time is they only come to you when they need you and kind of drag you through the mud and aren't even a good friend to you and you're still holding on to nothing because you think that you can sneak back into their life by being their friend it doesn't work ever so good job not wanting to be friends and the times that I've seen it work the reason they're saying they want to be friends is because they do still have some feelings for you they don't want to lose you completely but they have to lose you completely or accept you completely like those should be the only options because if those aren't the only options then they're going to choose the middle because the middle is easier so I would wear it like this I would like to be your friend but I can't authentically do that because I still have feelings for you I think our relationship was really special and I would like to work on it but because of that I can't be friends if you ever want to work towards that you can reach out to me but until then I don't think we should talk that's what I would do because it makes them decide they either have to have nothing or be in a relationship because if there is the middle option they will choose the middle option and the middle option sucks for you okay solitary rain says hey Cole my ex said she isn't going to invite crap it shot it to the top one second uh okay isn't going to invite me inside anymore while dropping off my son weird isn't it now she's different again that is weird dude I would say because you didn't you didn't really like do anything bad so I would think either she's still trying to push feelings down so she doesn't want to see you because it brings back feelings which that would be good or she's mad for some reason so I think about those two things I don't I don't really know what she'd be mad about heck you didn't do anything to push her so okay justice has been talking to my ex all week now just like old times now I haven't heard from her today she's an interesting one Justin I would keep letting her come back at her own speed like you're doing because it seems to be working but I do think there's got to be a point where you decide kind of like when you are done um because like it is like I think it would be really painful to like get these halfway things and never know what's going on so I would think about that but yeah do ex's ever come back even if you don't think they will I've seen that they come back about half the time and 100 of the people think they will never come back okay why do some men need to cheat he keeps begging for me back but won't stop because they hate themselves probably I think yeah with most things like that it's because you don't like yourself so you try to sabotage good things you have they don't need to cheat nobody needs to cheat so yeah like I do think sometimes like in marriages and stuff people can be neglected like maybe if if like you have like a lot of mental health concerns and and they they get neglected then that's a tough situation and I think that can be more conducive to cheating but it's not it's not like it's still their choice to cheat in something no one should ever do like even if you're in the situation where it would be it'd be easier for you to cheat because like you're being really neglected um you should never it's still not worth it okay um I don't know if I have any bookings left today I don't think so but I do on Monday if you want to book then okay sad part is I'm so willing to work on everything with him but he just seems hopeless and is like yeah they shouldn't he's choosing nobody is yeah I can't say that about self-sabotage um Laura type it one more time and I'll try to find him there um so also also I'll answer Sinister 92. so yeah I'll do those two but the self-sabotage thing if you don't like yourself then you're going to do things to get rid of the good things that you have because you don't think you deserve them and part of that is cheating so it could be that but that's that's what I think there you really do if you don't like yourself you really do stop yourself from good things because you don't think that you deserve them so liking yourself is really really important dude I live with my ex she got a birthday tomorrow what do I do please answer so in long term I would focus on moving out like as in like long as in not tomorrow because you probably can't move out tomorrow but you should as soon as you can like I know a lot of people say like it's not it's not okay to do like there's it's not like monetarily the best decision or any of that or it's difficult it should be something you're working towards it's gonna mess the heck out of your brain to live with an ex and never feel like you like can get them back so yeah I would I would definitely focus on moving out for tomorrow if you live together like I think it'd be okay to say happy birthday or something I don't know how much you you like talk right now um but do kind of if you're like just really cold and ignore each other where's the Green Top from Champion um then yeah I guess it depends on how what your Dynamic is like do you guys talk like since you live with each other and all that um yeah but I think I don't think it's bad to say happy birthday if you've lived together like it'd be weird if you just have been talking and then all of a sudden it's their birthday you do nothing like but you should focus on moving out do you think her actively looking for new places to live in town means she's moved on hmm I do think it's it's her trying to move on Andrew like it's it's another step into her being okay on her own I do think it's a way of her moving on yes yeah because another thing that she would have to like it's another step taking away why is the dumper happy after breaking up they're not they're not happy they're relieved like it's it's kind of really weird how many people even you even use the word relieved like that is they always say their relief like after my divorce when I was talking to my ex-wife she was like I just feel relieved thinking about not being with you and then like other friends that I talked to that have broken up with people they say they feel relief and then other people like the dumpers they call me and ask like what they're gonna do now they say they felt relieved and the reason why is because breaking up with someone is hard like people usually don't just get in if I can do it they think about it and think about it and think about it and finally they get over the hill and do it and they're really relieved because they don't have that inner conflict anymore because they finally made a decision they don't have to beat themselves up back and forth in their head and that feels awesome but it doesn't mean they're happy and over time that relief Fades and that's when people actually get curious and think about things more but you do have to let them let that relief fade because if you continue to message them and all that kind of stuff the relief never Fades because they never get to actually feel they're not relieved because you're trying to shove them back into that uncomfortable place they just got out of okay sailor says I'm the dumper I'm not really for breaking up I had I feel like I had to walk for his lack of effort that's interesting yeah so I guess it could be either one of those most people feel relieved but some people do just get the courage to leave something that's not good for them which maybe you will feel relief eventually for that because if someone's not giving any effort towards you I think it's a good job that you did that you did leave and he would have to really change for anything to happen in the future but yeah I think that's cool by the way like if you don't feel like you have any support because I feel like the dumpers don't get any support good job if you left someone that um the self-sabotage thing happened to me okay I'm gonna talk about that soon but if you left because someone was not giving you any love that's awesome good job like that's really hard to do um but you will be happier for putting yourself first in those situations okay so um crap I keep seeing all these different ones and I don't um oh self-sabotage okay yeah so um I'll talk about me on that so for me after my divorce I've been like kind of scared of getting married just because like it was getting divorced was the most painful thing that I've ever done and because of that in relationships when like marriage comes up my brain like can kind of attack itself and cause me to do things that like push the person I'm with away all right so if you're doing something like that if you're self-sabotaging crap I think the book's in my truck there's a book called no bad parts I would read if I were you if you feel like you have any of the self-sabotaging things find a book called no bad parts it's written by Richard Schwartz all right I would read that that's going to stop you from doing it or at least get you to control it I still feel like um there's parts of me that like get stressed and I could choose to sabotage but I don't have to do it anymore because I've worked through that I'm still working on it but that's what I would start with if I were you two that were talking about um that self-sabotaging stuff it really helps like it makes a big difference I can't get over my abusive ex I'm ashamed Mariana okay so if if you know that your ex is abusive you can't get over them first of all I would say that you're awesome one thing is that you really know how to love someone and it's hard for you to get over love so that is awesome that you did that it's also awesome that you're not with that person anymore if they were abusing you and you had the strength to like get out of that that's freaking awesome so I'd first start by congratulating yourself on both of those things because like all the ashamed stuff first of all shame should go down as you talk to people on this so I would join the Discord and talk to people about how you feel I think that would make the shame go away but also just doing it today should help a little bit um but first of all those are two things that you're awesome at you know how to love someone deeply and you know how to respect yourself enough to get out of the relationship it's not good for you that's awesome so now what I would do is how do you join the Discord there's a link in my bio like on my Tick Tock file under the follow button um so click up there on my name and then click the bio Link Link tree thing and then click the third one down is join the Discord so um now there's Jordan Peterson someone I think is really smart and cool he's on the internet and one of his rules for living a happy life is treat yourself like someone you're responsible for caring for that will make you less ashamed to be you so think about things you need your body needs healthy food your body needs exercise your body needs good sleep after that those are the basic things you should be doing those first after that your body needs friends and to do things that you enjoy hobbies and things like that so I would do those things first and even if you hate doing them do them because you are responsible for caring for you but as you care for yourself better you're going to show your brain that you're a more important person than you think you are because you're working really hard to take care of yourself and as you do that I think that shame will go down but for now just be proud of yourself for knowing how to love and be proud of yourself for knowing how to take care of yourself by leaving cool okay keep going Solitaire rain said yeah she said that it would be better because she doesn't know what she ever wants now she said that she needed to tell me that she ever wants it because of Hope okay hey PCT sheets nice to see you so yeah I think she just needs more space to think then is what it sounds like to me I would respect it and not go inside and just give her all this fish she wants that's what I would do my ex does one photo of me on social media three months since the breakup does that mean anything hmm um I don't know depends like are they the kind of person that just keeps stuff up to remember memories like I have a picture of an ex up still because I thought my Halloween costume was really cool so yeah think about that think about like why would they have it up if it doesn't mean anything like it could I guess still mean something like they're holding on and giving you a little bit of Hope but yeah Laura Villa Gomez keeps saying please I don't see are you seeing my question okay I'm still going up um no can you retype it it might be really high up there I'm pretty high up and I just don't see it so I'll answer it though if you type it I'll look for it but at the moment I don't see it yeah okay so as Gilbert you're on here a lot um I told my ex I don't want to contact when he started dating other girls and now he stopped dating it's kind of cool yeah I'd still wait for him to text you but it sounds like like maybe he like at least doesn't want to lose you enough to stop that so that's kind of awesome but good job doing that like that's that shows people um if I'm an interpreter right at least but it should show people that if you set boundaries that put yourself at a high value people are going to Value you more whereas if you beg and say I'll have you back no matter what you do they value you less and you're not attractive and they won't want to be with you because people always want to feel like they're winning something good in dating so if the more you beg and the less you value yourself okay I see it Laura um then and they're gonna want you more if you value yourself high can you talk about ex wanting space to find happiness for himself and then make it together okay so a lot of people break up with you and say I need space to find happiness for myself find out who I am um just to understand my brain and then after I do that we'll go back together a lot of people say that most of the time when they say that I think it's just to make the breakup easier so that like it won't make you really sad like most of the time when people are like we'll get back together later after I figure stuff out um I don't think they intend for that to happen but the thing that that actually happens is when they have space they can actually feel like you are um they can actually feel like they miss you so you do need to give the space I wouldn't put all my Hope on on getting back just because I do think that a lot of people say that but give them the space and they'll actually be able to feel like what it's like to not be with you and that's what will make them come back not not they're gonna figure it out in their head and they're going to come back that's usually bull crap but them actually feeling that they miss you and coming back is is when they do okay filo 98 hey Cole I have this girl she talks to me she laughs but the problem is she won't text me first okay um let's interview all the girls again because that was really fun so all the girls in here if is what are the reasons you won't text a guy first like if you actually like him because yeah if you if you talk to a girl and she's laughing at every everything you say she probably likes you this I hope that's that's what I've always thought but what are the reasons that you guys wouldn't text first are there like Unwritten rules that some girls think they just can never text first okay we're shy we're waiting for him to make the first move I wouldn't text first if I like you or not okay yeah why are all these things true because it sounds like he does he does text okay there's a lot of answers I'll read them all um we want the guy to be interested first um Jocelyn says didn't want to seem too needy you texted me first though um Kayla says if she likes you she'll reply fast she won't text first but she'll reply fast um this person Haley says I won't text first if I feel like he's not showing enough interest or setting dates or communicating um I do text first but she probably doesn't want to make the first move too scared of being rejected afraid of seeming annoying guys thank you girl is too eager if they text first and then go away I agree waiting for him to make the first move cool okay yeah that's true Jocelyn only texted me first the first time but then she did wait for me to make moves okay so yeah so if if you are but it sounds like one more thing all girls it sounds like he is texting first a lot of the time like it says she never wants to text first so how I interpret that is she is he's like texting her but um I think you should move to hang out or calling I agree but it sounds like he's texting her but she just never texts first or he feels like he's always initiating everything is there a reason that any of you would not initiate at that point like I guess I guess dude if she if she still is like shy and feels like um you would still consider her annoying or anything like that this girl says he should pull back and she will reach out maybe give her space to text first okay yeah I think those are valid too okay cool we work together in the same Department how do I do no contact so there is like if you work together if you have kids together if you have any sort of reason that you need to talk to your ex still like that you have to like an obligation you still talk to them but only about the thing that you have to talk to them about so I would just talk to them about work I wouldn't be like cold or mean but I wouldn't have small talk I wouldn't initiate anything except for like asking where these shoes go if you actually need to know like I could also see you doing like you already know where the shoes go but you just want to go ask her if you have summer to talk to her about so avoid all of those things only talk to them when you have to and then they still get the benefits of no contact because they don't get the support they used to what I do now my ex blocked me so MCAT seven nothing like if they blocked you it won't let me add the Discord it should did you click the link and does it let you to give you the free invite it's still it doesn't cost anything or anything um so if you just got blocked by your ex you need to stay blocked it's it's kind of like a new level of testing that you are in that if you end up like doing a fake email or calling from a different number or having friends ask or all these type of things they can always see that and it always pushes them further away so in some ways it's a good thing because it actually like cuts off everything so they can be more curious okay Rosemary Lloyd says husband won't fight for me but tells me he loves me what should I do what do I do if we're still on Snap or no contact during streaks I would stop doing streaks 100 percent um okay Rosemary Lloyd won't fight for me but he tells me he loves me what should I do what does that mean what does it mean he won't fight for you like what does that mean and does he know that he has to like do that like that's another thing I would I would worry about it is if you have like these needs that you think count as fighting for you and he doesn't know what those are um shed Blocker on snap I just wouldn't open it anymore um or I would open it just not send a reply so you know if she's actually reaching out for something else but yeah um he loves me but he said we should get divorced okay there's a problem if someone needs to fight for you that's a good think of too okay why does he want a divorce if he still loves you what's what's the problem that he wants a divorce for and let's keep talking to it so comment again like I want to know like what does he want he has to if he still loves you okay I'm gonna answer another one while you type that all right um we cuddled good job can a rebound be anyone yeah my ex and I are still best friends but we broke up for the same reason he wanted to before but didn't because we cuddled my ex and I are still best friends but we broke up for the same reason he wanted to before but didn't because we cuddled okay um for the I would I would worry about you guys being best friends wants to be free okay all right Rosemary so how long have you been okay I have another question though how long have you been married and did anything lead up to him wanting to be free Sarah Marie he said he doesn't want to be with me but he didn't lose any feelings is that even possible I don't think so I think people usually do what they feel I think he might just be trying to make you feel good my husband wants his freedom doesn't like being married but says he still loves me okay that sounds stupid that sounds like he's really like immature the thing I would research if I were you is avoid an attachment style and see if that sounds like him just because that's kind of something you can work with but I would let him be as free as he wants because if it's just him trying to go through this like if it's like a midlife crisis or anything like that and he wants to be free you holding on I think would cause him to want to be free more if people want to be free and they can't feel like they can't they usually fight harder to be free but if he comes Crawling Back to You and crying I would be really careful in taking him back if you guys have a family and kids together I would weigh that in really heavily because I think kids deserve to have both of their parents and that's like I do think that divorce is necessary sometimes but you should go through a lot of crap I think to make sure your kids have parents like I think that is that is something that makes more effort worth it um but if he comes back and he just wanted to accept his freedom and then he like realizes that it was stupid um then then I would I would I guess what I'd work on most is just doing things to build your own self-esteem because it needs to be really really high you need to love being you if he comes back and um and yeah if he wants to be back together after doing something like that but right now the truth is is if he still loves you but is choosing to be free then it sounds like he wants that freedom more than his love is which is really hurtful so I would consider that as like not like not a good thing like I would take care of yourself above that I think all right I'm gonna move on but I'm I'm really sorry that's a really hard one okay I was needy and emotional the last day of our three years he say lost feelings what should I do I let him go and he wanted to be free yeah so if you're really needy and can I Define narcissistic sure um if you were really really needy and the last day that's fine like most of the time that Colby okay I'll answer that too um most of the time if you crap I'm thinking of three different things oh yeah okay so most the time if you um hmm I do remember if you really needed at the end or you beg at the end it's fine because it usually is just interpreted as you really wanted the relationship to work after that though like you should not keep begging for weeks or months that's when it gets bad because that's when the person feels trapped and they run further and further away if it's just at the beginning though it's fine that's kind of normal so I wouldn't feel really bad about it but for now give the space and go actual no contact narcissistic narcissistic people it's an actual like I'm going to look up the definition because I think this one's important it's an actual like medical disorder narcissistic Personnel narcissist it's also really hard to spell one um narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which people have unreasonably high sense of their own self-importance of their own importance they need to seek too much they need and see too much attention and want people to admire them people with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others I think that that last sentence is really important because pretty much like 90 of the people who break up right now say that their ex is narcissistic and this this thing says that it's really rare with fewer than 200 000 cases per year so that's tiny compared to like like if that's talking about the US there's 330 million people in the U.S only 200 000 have this yet every single person who goes through a breakup thinks that their ex is narcissistic so it's they're not most the time it's just immaturity I think there's a difference narcissistic from what I understand here is they lack the ability to care about the feelings of others so yeah that's a good thing too someone said narcissistic narcissism is a spectrum many people have some traits but not a full disorder the full disorder I think would be really hard to work with and takes a lot of therapy and that they like literally are not capable of caring about your feelings because they're so absorbent themselves most people and what most people I think call narcissism is just being emotionally immature and if you're like if you're really insecure and don't aren't totally confident yourself then you're going to like seem really proud or you're going to put other people down to make yourself higher and that's just being immature that can be worked through but I think narcissism is extremely overused because everyone says it and it's I think it's like two percent of the population is that if it in the math right but yeah cool whoa it's already almost two okay I'll do one more um but also I'll do a commercial too I don't do enough commercials thanks cam um so free call giveaway this one was Daisy but if you guys want to enter for it join the patreon it's the link in my bio I'll also love you more um but I'm trying to build a big community of people who are going through divorces and breakups that can help each other so if you believe in that mission join the patreon that's what it's for as we grow bigger and bigger I'm gonna try to make actual live big events that people can come and meet each other and have real life support but I need help on here to do that so that's what that's really for I'm trying to give away things like free calls and extra videos to push people to do it now but if you believe in that mission supported there if you need help um do this your Discord says expired when I try to connect it thank you okay yeah the link only works for seven days so it must have expired so I'll add a new one um right after this and you should be able to get in cool all right so I'll do one more though he says I love you every night we've been broken up for three months tell him to stop I would definitely 100 set the boundary there I would say if if um if they're texting like crazy but especially if they're saying I love you every single night say don't anymore like they're comfortable where they are they're comfortable not being with you because they can be with other people but still having you on a leash so you need to tell them I love you too I really want to work for this but all of this like suffering because you won't commit to me and I'm hearing I love you every night isn't working um you can reach out to me if you change your mind and actually want to get back together but until then we can talk that's how we do and I think that would increase your chances of being with that person because you're going to seem more valuable you're also going to feel more valuable because you're treating yourself better okay land so I don't do um I don't do personal messages because decide to get too many um but if you want to talk I do on here that Link's in my bio too okay cool all right guys I hope you have an awesome weekend I'll fix that Discord link so you guys can get in um but yeah hope you guys have a great weekend and I'll be back on here on Monday I'll let you know when it is see you later
what if your ex doesn't answer you we'll talk about that too and also I wanted to go over like a basic like rundown of what attachment styles are too because I think it's been like a little bit um since we talked about that and I think it's really important for everyone to have a good understanding of those things okay so we'll start out with let's start out with that actually I'm going to start out with the attachment style thing and then after that we'll get to questions just because like for me learning basically what attachment styles are good to see you 2G money um learning about what those are I'm sorry about that Asia Hawkins um yeah okay so I'm going to talk about that for like probably three minutes just so everyone has a good like um no this is actually a Harley shirt I have a Harley hat and Harley shirt right now but yeah I'll talk about that and then we'll get into regular questions hey how do I get a call so those calls are right here if you click the link in my bio um and then the the top one that says let's make a plan it'll be there you can sign up for it okay sick so attachment Styles there's basically three kinds there's four really and I'll talk about it in a second but there's three main ones that pretty much Everyone Falls under and it's basically just a way of understanding why people act the way they do in relationships that's sick Igor and if you like if you understand that then you're going to understand basically why you do what you do in relationships and also why your ex or your partner did what they did in relationships so there's secure anxious and avoidant are the basic categories and they all start when you're really young because you learn about what love is from your parents thank you g money let me see if I can see them from up here oh no um so yeah based on how your parents show you love is what you what category you fall into and it doesn't mean that you're stuck in whatever category you're in I think that's really important too A lot of people think that like they say okay I'm anxious so I'm stuck that way you're not everybody can get to secure and I think it's really important to understand secured so you know what like your goal is and where you want to get to as well so we'll talk about secure first so if you grow up that's so cool you're from Greece that's awesome hello Zoe oh yeah so if you grow up and you are showed love from your parents consistently and your needs are met then you can grow up believing that love is just something that you deserve and those people in their regular relationships never are afraid of their ex leaving they are really confident that like they're loved they don't think their ex is going to cheat on them they're okay if their love kind of drifts away or is busy at work they're okay if they're exes or their relationship is like close those people are called secure and again it starts because their parents show them that they're important and their needs are met not everyone gets that when they're growing up and that's why about half the population falls under insecurely attached and there's two main types the first one is anxious so those people in regular relationships are described as like clingy they might start fights often accusing their relationship partner of cheating on them or things like that and overall it just comes from a belief that you don't feel like you're good enough and that you like have to really hold on tightly to love because you might not get it again those people also have a really really hard time with losing their partner and going through breakups because again they think that like love is something they need to hold on to really really tightly because they they don't feel like they really deserve it so why would they find someone else that's as good as the person they just lost so those people are like that because when they're little their parents may have been inconsistent in showing them that love and meeting their needs their parents may have been really busy at work or had some mental health issues of their own and all those kinds of things okay so if that's the case you can get better from that and we'll talk about that at the end in a second the other one though before we get to that is avoidance so those people have the same thing happen where they get their needs met inconsistently but instead of holding on really tightly to love they just decided that they need to go within themselves not rely on anybody and not share their feelings because they can't get hurt if they don't share their feelings and those people often cause breakups when they get too serious like if you're meeting parents or if you're moving in together or if you're talking about getting married they may end it and again it's because they're scared not because they're mean so both of those insecure ones can be fixed by doing things to improve your self-esteem and that can be by getting a job that you love more or it can be by starting to do things that you love like Hobbies or things like that okay we might talk about that a little later but I do want to get into questions but those are those are basically the first the three types that most people fall into should I work should I wish my ex happy birthday this Thursday I generally don't think you should wish your ex happy birthday and this is why so basically with no contact you're giving them the chance to see what life is like without you in it they need to feel that in order for them to choose to come back if that's what they choose a birthday is a great time for them to feel that you're not in their life just because like being saying happy birthday and things like that are awesome parts of being in a relationship so if you give those those opportunities for them to feel that without actually having to commit to being with you then they probably will have less motivation to be with you so I always view that as like a great opportunity for you to show them that and I wouldn't waste it by saying happy birthday my birthday is coming up do you think she'll think about it usually I don't know of many people that break up with you and then don't even remember your birthday they usually do okay all right yeah let's keep questions coming okay do you think it is a bad idea to unblock an ex that blocked you first so you're blocked and then date and then you block them after and then you're wondering if you should unblock them um what do you think about this he really he really knows me he would have never left me um maybe like there can definitely be like okay on to that motivational quotes but yeah if if there was a lack of like communication and they never got to know you because you were like were like that avoidant one that we talked about at the beginning and you never got to actually share like who you were with that person then definitely yeah they could have left because they never got to know you that's why it's really important to actually share who you are in a relationship so yeah totally yeah okay g-money said my therapist told me to block all her socials so they don't pop up and Trigger me yeah totally so this is for motivational quotes if you feel like what G money just said that it's gonna pop up and Trigger you and all those things I would totally keep it all blocked if you feel like you're really working on repairing their relationship and you think there's actually a chance then I think that like having blocked would keep kind of set up a barrier this year and be able to talk to you as easily so you've gotta like see where you are in that it's going to be unique for each person which is why I do the one-on-one calls um but if they blocked you first they might not even know that you blocked them also so that's another thing to think about can I ask are men only have women friends considered weak that's interesting like who who's doing the considering like I I don't think I would um consider them weak um I do think that it's really important for guys to have guy friends because I think you can like I for me it's kind of like healing like I've had times in my life where I would only go on dates not hang out with any friends if if they were um thank you let's say if they were um like guys I would just go on dates and like my life was not as fun so I do think there's something healing about hanging out with like your Bros that you can only get from that but with that being said like I don't think the person's considered weak I just think it's kind of a different choice in how to live your life I don't I don't think it's like better or worse for me though I need both my ex reached out hoping I was doing okay I said the same and she didn't respond okay you did a good job a lot of times they do that just to text just to test the water it's okay though I would still reply I wouldn't ignore them um unless it becomes breadcrumbing which I just made a video about that so you can check that out or we'll talk about it if it keeps coming up but yeah I I think you did a good job they do that to test the water and make sure they can still reach out but usually it keeps going like that so I wouldn't freak out if they didn't respond after that one time I really have the feeling that I will never hear from her again orian bonjour okay you've been on here a long time I've seen you a lot of times um I do feel like everyone feels like that every single person and like from what I've seen about half half the people do end up getting back together and 100 of the people think they'll never hear from their person again so I'd have to do a call with you to really like give my best guess on if they are or not but it is like every every single person feels like that every single person does that because your brain kind of chooses the worst case scenario to like deal with it but yeah that's what I thought you need a mix of men and women frenzy I agree okay ex in a rebound but keeps texting and calling me why all right so this is something that I think is really important I just um I just saw this and then we'll do Jackal after um so if your ex isn't a rebound but they're texting and calling you right now you need to tell them that you're not comfortable with that happening like tell them maybe even tell them that you'll block them if they keep doing it like you need to set a really strong boundary there because it means for sure that their new relationship is a rebound like if it wasn't they wouldn't be like texting you and calling you and trying to fix things with you but also it means that they're not actually willing to commit because they don't think they'll actually lose you all the way so they need to feel like that because it's true they can't feel like they can have you as a second option and their primary option in their rebound that's not fair to either one of you so I would tell them that first that you're not comfortable hearing from them while they're with someone else and if they keep doing it I would block them okay jackalo says she doesn't want to come back to me because she thinks I will not change and doesn't believe my word time is the best thing it can heal that thank you Cam I'm having a good day um time's the best thing you can heal that so right now the best thing you can do to show her that you've changed is give her the space she asked for thank you for those glasses I'm getting a lot of glasses today um so show them that shower that you care for by giving her the spaces she probably asked for when she broke up with you that's the first thing the other thing is just by like living the best life you can people notice that like they say that they never look at you but like I have not talked to someone who broke up with someone that didn't like check on them every once in a while after ever they will check on you so hey pip Cube so the best thing you can do is like hang out with your friends look happy be doing things that makes your life better that's what's going to convince them that you've changed or keeping them on social media helped them detach and move on um no I don't I don't think it has anything to do with moving on um like do you mean is it better to just block them off everything so that they like don't won't be able to see everything and you're asking which one will be better not making them um move on that's what I'm wondering there I do think like both of them are fine I think it's a little better for them to see that you're like doing things that are good with your friends if you're planning on repairing it I think that's the best case scenario okay why does her mom and thank you snow that's cool welcome to level 11. thank you Mimi I have two hats on um why does her mom and Aunt constantly look at my social media and keep in touch okay I would if they're keeping in touch like that I would first I would set the boundary with them too the same way see that like I love hearing from you but I don't I don't I think it's the best right now it's difficult for me I would do that with their mom and Aunt I definitely think it might be um like them asking do your lives get saved somewhere um no but I might post them on YouTube because I can and I'm starting to do more YouTube so I actually think I will so yeah if you want to see the lives like a saved version click thank you for that dude um click um the little play button on my YouTube channel on the light right next to like follow on my Tick Tock profile and it'll have the YouTube thing subscribe there and then I'll post today's one on there for sure yeah I will can um do you think that prioritizing my present and their life is the most important thing okay so that this is for lowly 5420 are you talking about like while you're dating someone like like is there is prioritizing your presence the most important thing like in a relationship while you're dating them um so yeah that's that's my question for you is that what you mean do you mean like in a relationship while you're dating someone is is prioritizing presence the most important thing I ran into my ex exactly a year after the breakup she was parked next to my car at a restaurant wow what did you do what happened um yeah so if that's what you mean if if you do mean like is prioritizing presence most important it depends okay yes in a relationship cool it depends on what's important to you so this is kind of like the um yeah Mimi I am seeing them I saw them earlier but um can you can you post it again I didn't see what it was I don't have Alan this time so I'm just trying to read them as I go um so it's kind of I I think it's kind of with the five love languages with that question so there's physical touch um Quality Time gift giving acts of service and words of affirmation so you've got to kind of depend which one feels most important to you and you've got to actually ask your partner which one's most important too if you're talking about prioritizing time as most important that might be your primary love language and you've got to communicate that thank you snow you got to communicate that um I don't know where Alan is you got to communicate that to your partner so that they know that's the most important to you because you can't you can never just like expect people to know what's important in a relationship I think that's one of the biggest problems I see is a lot of people are like they should have known that this was the case or I would have felt this way if they did this they don't know they can't read your mind like make it easier for them tell them what you think they should know and I think that's a really important one so if quality time is the most important to you tell them that and figure out what's most important to them and see what you can do to help with that okay so Angel lover said more things because about so she ran into an ex next to a car I stood in shocked as she walked out of the restaurant with her new girlfriend and basically ran the other way but I was the one who ended their relationship with her and she's been stalking me for over a year wow interesting um you're welcome Alicia what do you what do you want to happen hey Tyler nice to see you what do you want to happen like are you wanting to get back together with her or do you just want to because you saw her with someone else like what's going on thank you g money welcome to level 14. I like how it gives you guys levels I have no idea what they mean but I do think level 14 is the highest one um he still has videos from a friend's wedding is it okay to break no contact to ask for it um depends what you want Alex so if you're focusing mainly on like getting back together with someone that does count as like regularly breaking no contact and he's probably gonna think that you're doing it to talk to him that's why that's what he's going to assume he's like she doesn't really want the video she's doing this to reach out to me and I'm I don't know that might be true but like if you're just focusing on moving on then I totally think it's fine to just get the videos but yeah I would focus on getting him another way if you're focusing on repairing it because I think it would set you back wise Max on dating apps so quick that's super common pretty much everyone does it and I hope a lot of you aren't doing it like don't don't um if you're focusing on getting on dating apps to feel better about yourself it's going to make you feel a lot worse okay so don't don't get them if you're trying to do that now looking at the other way that is why your ex is getting them they don't want to feel alone they want to feel like they're still desired and um yeah no I'm just attaching and this was a coincidence or if I should generally be concerned I'd moved on now I think it's probably just a coincidence angel you're like you can run into each other at the same restaurant um but so if that's happening like if if your ex is on a dating app right now most of the time thank you snow what level are you now uh you're still the same level so you're 11 G minus 14. he's beating you um but yeah if if they're on dating apps right away it's to make themselves feel better they don't want to feel alone they want to feel desired still that's why they're doing it they're not dealing with their feelings about getting over you which is like a problem it's going to make them have to like still go through all the feelings they're not going to avoid it that's really competition um yeah g-money's number one now so yeah that's what I would think with with the um with the dating apps what do you do if you get no closure Celestia ow L okay this is gonna be the case for a lot of you I think closure can help to move on sometimes for some people I didn't get it and if this question is asking specifically for me um this is what I did because I didn't like after my divorce and stuff I've never had closure and I don't know if I ever will um but realizing Mimi I'm seeing this one I'm just seeing you asking me for if I saw your question I'll try to scroll up though and see if I can find it but yeah I didn't get it um as far as I know like she just still hates me and everything and yeah I didn't see it Mimi um the last one I see before that is asking where Alan is so yeah I I didn't get it and the thing that helped me the most was realizing that she doesn't know the current me she hasn't talked to me in two years so she can't person run or any of that stuff and like yeah just realizing that like I know myself better than anyone else can and that I've made a lot of progress in my character and working on becoming the best version of myself that I can that helps another thing that's really helped me is finding someone that loves me now which again like if you just barely got divorced or broken up with I would give yourself time like I'm posting a YouTube video about it in on Monday next Monday like this coming Monday about how to date after getting divorced or broken up with but if if that's the case give yourself some time I wouldn't like I wouldn't start out of nowhere but finding someone who will love you for who you are now helps convince yourself also welcome level 12 snow helps convince yourself also that um that you have the closure you need so those are things that helped to summarize is realize that they don't know who you are anymore because it's been some time and you've made some changes and also once you've made enough changes try dating someone else and them loving you in the present can be um okay um pip cute asks if I've drawn in all of it a little bit so I have like I've been working on these eyes so that's eyes um this is Jocelyn's sister did this to show me how to do the proportions which is really good so I've been um that's my ugly proportion one right now and I'm gonna make that into um into a picture of her later today but yeah staying single and been happy by yourself should be the main goal yeah you got to do that first if if you just barely gone through a breakup then you've definitely got to learn to be okay being you first definitely if you aren't okay just being you then you're not going to be able to helpfully offer anything to someone else I like that you guys are in this little battle it's kind of fun to watch Okay g money says ex introduce her girlfriend to her family in person and met her girlfriend's family seems serious I don't know dude I still think how long do you think it's okay to move on that's a good question I still think they're trying to like blast through this relationship in like a second so like yeah I don't like even if it was not anything to do oh I did see your question this time Mimi um I I don't think that like even if it had nothing to do with like um changing sexuality and going from a divorce and all this even as just a regular relationship and I saw them like blasting through everything like immediately traveling all over to see each other and immediately seeing families and all these things without taking the time to build up emotional connection first I would still think that wasn't very stable like relationships work best when you take things slow and hit Milestones after you've had time to develop emotional connection with each other try to blast everything together it usually ends and I think with that plus all the other problems too then yeah okay so I'm gonna do nikitara after this one with Mimi haven't heard from him even three months even after three months and progress signs he's super avoidant what to expect what are the progress signs again Mimi I kind of remember him but not I answer a lot of questions on these um three months for an avoidant I think would be pretty normal that you wouldn't hear yet just because who towel just because um like if they're avoiding I think it'd be closer like four to six ish months but what are the signs you've seen I forgot I think it was something about songs or something or something on Instagram right okay how to be me after losing myself 13 years back guitar 69. okay so if you don't remember who you are anymore and this can be really common I think even more for girls like I think a lot of girls in relationships kind of adopt the hobbies and sometimes even the friend groups of like the guy they're dating and then once they break up they're like what do I even do anymore like I don't I don't know I can't like maybe you started liking basketball or like dirt bikes or like fishing um and now like you're not with that person anymore so you're like what do I even like to do you can figure it out by trying lots of new things so if you haven't been you for like 13 years you can probably be whoever you want to be now so I would sign up for lots of like classes and stuff and figure out what you like to do like I did singing classes and I taught guitar lessons and I did Jiu Jitsu hey Daisy nice to see you um and yeah Daisy I don't know if you're in are you in the Facebook group for the um for the patreon live yet I don't think I've seen you in there um ex has no way to check I mean if she blocked me how do I put myself into a position of power okay we'll do that one after this one I'm done talking about this one so yeah I would definitely um get there look at the post on the patreon thing they're supposed to join it um unlike the patreon page that you're signed up for so yeah start new classes what's something that you've always wanted to do like that's what I would focus on and even if it's weird like even if you're just like when you were little you like thought that it would be cool if you played the violin try see what happens find Who You Are by trying new things like that and then you'll find and you'll be able to live your life for yourself and then when you're with someone again you can offer them a whole life instead of just clamping onto their life okay so Andrew is blocked everywhere something out of position of power let me find it read it again Max has no way to check on me as she blocked me how do I put myself back into a position of power okay oh thanks for posting again dude so again I do think that the thing that makes people miss you is the past good experiences that you've had I do think that you offered her a lot in the relationship like you went to therapy and stuff to make yourself better um sounds like you were always really kind and accepting of her all the time too like I really think that the problem has mainly to do with things about her past trauma that she never worked on which we talked about so I really think that if it's going to work it's going to because it's going to be cut it's going to be because she remembers the good things that you did for her and if she ever Works through that stuff which is hard because yeah that's not a position of power so the thing for the position of power I like the plan of like I keep working on your house and like getting it sold and all those things and continue to like make your wardrobe better and make your life better like the best thing you can do is just make yourself the best version of you so you're happy which is going to be really rough but you're doing a fantastic job like you're doing everything right but as for getting back together I really do think it has to do with her figuring out stuff in her own mind what does it mean if she continuously goes out with her friends so that's really normal I talk about it I just barely made I'm redoing that series stages after breakup because it usually seems to do well um let me see that did you see my response call let me scroll up and find it there's a lot of things going by um so I'm remaking that but if they are I didn't I don't think I saw it Mimi I didn't it's not on there your account's weird yours like doesn't post everything you post I only like some of them um but yeah if if your ex is starting to go out with their friends and stuff after the breakup that is super super common everyone does that pretty much like going out with friends starting to do things that they don't usually do and um hey I got hey I gotta hey can we talk today and I just deleted her that opening answer Emma um yeah so if they're starting to go out with friends and do all that stuff it's super super common in a sign of the relief stage after they break up with you they feel really free and kind of want to get everything they can out of that freedom see it now no I'm just seeing that one Mimi I'm sorry um do the patreon one I'm doing it live on patreon right after this and I can talk to you it's actually a video call so it's even more personal than this so we can talk about your whole story and everything but there's not that many people on there now there's only like nine people on the patreon so it's really personal at the moment so if you feel like you need more personal help um patreon is in my bio on the account so yeah it's the same price right now as the as The Tick Tock subscription was so if you're doing that just do this instead I think it's a lot better but yeah it is um sure can you repost your question Hannah I don't I haven't seen it um so yeah if they're doing all that stuff going out with their ex or going out with um their friends and also like doing tons of things they wouldn't usually do like maybe they're drinking all the time now maybe they're staying out late going to parties when they used to be like more of an introvert that is super common the reason why which I talk about in that video is they usually deal with the conflict a conflict in their mind on whether to break up with you or not for weeks or months back and forth back and forth I'm gonna do it I'm not going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to do it so it feels like a lot of pressure when they finally do it that pressure goes away so they feel free so they go and exercise that freedom in a lot of different ways it usually only lasts like a week to a couple months because um that's usually not who they are like they got to go back to being who they used to be like maybe they don't actually go drinking maybe that's just the thing they're doing now because they feel super free and after that is when they become curious I'm posting a video on that today but yeah can I can a next come back after nine years together now with someone else after a month and she says she loves him okay so this is for d88w2 it depends with really long relationships like that you've got to look to see if she moved on during the relationship and you've got to also see like why the relationship ended and if she can feel like hopeless about it getting back together so if you notice that she withdrew more and more and more wouldn't talk to you about her feelings or anything stopped fighting you and all those type of things like that it could mean that she withdrew at the end of the relationship if she did that then I do think she could actually get in a relationship with someone else and actually love them if they didn't and it seemed like she was fighting and fighting and fighting then it just ended and then a month later God was someone else I think that would be more of a rebound and I would think there's a lot better chance of getting back together um if you want to do a one-on-one I think we can really go through the details and I could help you figure that out but with just that information that's what I would think about okay yeah if I didn't get closer should I give him back his stuff I think you should always give back the stuff as soon as you can so that no contact can be clean and there's no no stuff or anything like that about how long does a dumper take to reach out after no contact depends on lots of things depends how long you were together you too angel thank you depends how long you're together depends how long like or why it ended depends what you did at the end lots of things again that's why there's a one-on-one calls I'm doing 25 20 off right now for everyone um just because like um after I don't post videos for a week my calls kind of go down I'm trying to bring them back up so I've just got a couple so I'm pretty free right now so if you want to do one I'm doing 20 off on all that um and then we could figure out like really all those details which I think I'd be able to give a lot better timeline if I knew what's going on and a plan on how to avoid common mistakes because it's kind of crazy how common the mistakes are and how like similar everyone messes up so yeah also if you join the patreon which we just talked about before that's they're both of these things are in the link in my bio there's a link tree and you can click either one um I'd give a free call away to patrons every Friday so Denise won this week's one and someone else will win um on Friday yeah then Shadow storm just posted the Discord link so if you want to join the Discord and have friends that's the Discord link there's an even snow made it freaking awesome there's even games you can play in there now like a music quiz if you feel like you're just kind of going crazy there's games you can play to distract yourself people you can talk to it's an amazing thing so I would join that if you haven't yet okay my breakup was three weeks ago I texted her three to four times I texted her every three to four days is it too late for no contact no so um if my ex texted my mom she misses me and calling me from no caller ID two months no contact okay we'll talk about that in a second um so if you texted at the beginning it's okay that most of the time just shows them that you really wanted to work on it and care you have to start no contact now though the longer you go the less um the less it's gonna work like the less time is gonna the less the more time you're giving them to move on the more you contact them after the breakup the more reasons you're giving them to move on to so no I would definitely start now God separated the relationship for a reason focus on you and he will make it work if it's supposed to I agree that's awesome okay all right let's show this one my ex texted my mom she missed me and calling me for no caller ID two months of no contact okay so I would think that she'd already gone through kind of curiosity now she's concerned about what's going on so I would definitely reply if you can um like answer the phone if you can let her keep coming but if she's coming make sure that it's kind of difficult one of the biggest mistakes I see most people happen is that they take their ex back and then they just break up immediately again like after a week and that's because it was too easy if your ex is coming back make sure you say you're open to getting back together but you want to take things slow and go on dates if you just do that you're going to make your chances go up by us so much because like yeah what I've seen like pretty much like half of people break up again pretty instantly pretty much instantaneously if they don't make it a little difficult let me get back yeah yeah Jeff felneck um you will bring them back or bring something new it's a win-win yep if she says this is this one is from um Jack Hollow 8192 if she says she's still if she loves me still but doesn't believe I will change is there a chance still yeah show her just by like what we talked about a second ago that's good though that means she still cares so she has motivation for making things work but like I would give her the the space I wouldn't bug her and I would focus on making yourself better like as best you can start by looking at the relationship and what does she not trust you about how can you fix that what can you change in your character so that you don't make those same mistakes again and like that person just said it's a win-win either she will come back because she loves you or you'll be able to love someone else in a better way than you ever could and the more you're able to love someone the more they can love you back too so a lot of people say like if they broke up with someone that they'll they'll never find a relationship as deep as that one or as special as that one pretty much everyone feels like that actually from what I've seen the more you develop yourself the deeper relationship you're care you're capable of so if you're with someone and you felt like it was perfect and then you broke up and then you and then you work on yourself you become better at communicating you become better being vulnerable you work out so you're happy with your body you're healthy so you feel good and you're able to present yourself in a happy way you are going to have a relationship that's happier than your last one because you're capable of attracting that kind of person so yeah if you work on yourself like that you do have a win-win I've decided to speak with my ex about nothing that is an urgent child thing I hope to drive her crazy wow um it probably will okay he was with friends at the moment so I left but he wants to meet up and talk do you think he wants me I don't know yet I would meet up and talk though I'd see does no contact actually work he broke up with me and looks like he's moving on so at the beginning it always looks like that do I have a book no that'd be kind of cool though but no I do not um what should I write it on it'd be kind of Awesome let's say it was an author um but okay hey I broke up with my ex because he didn't put in a lot of effort but I missed him and went to his house okay I don't think it's going to get better I'll talk about that after I talk about the last one so um I'll talk about that after I talk about the last one let me do this one first and I'll do that one because I think they're both important so after breakup it's gonna look like everybody's moving on everybody who breaks up with you okay and um yeah it's gonna be really hard it's going to look like that for everybody no contact works for Miriam if you want to talk to me these are 24 20 off right now so um but if if you go no contact this is what's going to happen number one it's going to give them the opportunity to miss you and see what it's like that's the only way that they're going to come back if they are going to okay the times that no contact doesn't work to bring someone back is because they weren't going to come back anyway what you're doing is showing them respect and giving them the opportunity to feel what it's like to not be with you so they can choose between those two options if you don't give them that opportunity they don't have the opportunity to choose so that's the first thing the other thing which is more important arguably is you're going to give yourself the chance to feel better and find out who you are on your own which is invaluable so yeah call your advice work for meeting up next week that's sync dude awesome okay so the other one was you broke up with him because he wasn't giving enough effort you went over to talk to him or something I think based off okay I went to his house and I left because his friends were at his house now he wants to meet up and talk okay so the best way you can handle it is to make it not super easy you need to give him the opportunity to change so I would say I would say that you miss him and all that stuff because you are still the one that has the ball in your court if you're the one who broke it out but find out exactly and write it down in your journal what it would look like for you to feel like you're loved enough it needs to be really specific so you know so I would figure that out first before you talk with him then if you go and he's like I'll do anything and anything tell them really specifically what you expect and say that you want to go slow and see if he can do it so just go on dates and stuff then say you're open to it but you need to go slow kind of similar what we talk about the other direction you need to do that though if you just take him back instantly then I think he'll be exactly the same he might be like give more for like a month or a couple weeks and then go exactly the same and you're gonna feel sad again so I would try that but be really objective like have your friends tell them what's going on and see what they think and all that stuff so does no contact apply to a situationship um cool yeah we just got a new Patron hoodie man 42. nice to see you um so for hoodie man 42 if you just did that on um always busy yeah so write that down see how much time do you need write down exactly what that is become super clear with yourself on it so you can tell him clearly if you can't tell him clearly he's not going to know what to do okay so for already Man 42 if you just join the patreon there's a live call after this it's going to start right when this ends at one but you've got to join the Facebook group so there's a post a couple posts down that um has a point to join the Facebook group if you do that you'll be able to get on the call today but you are in for the um giveaway so cool okay we'll keep going okay so let's keep reading this this same the same girl is talking so we'll go on that one then we'll do Hannah because I found that I blocked my eggs after one month in a few days he later blocked me too he has a new girlfriend when I come back okay I'll answer that one after we finish this one so it's not like he's begging on his knees for me so I doubt it will work if I act distant I did break it off okay so I wouldn't act distant talk about it and see what happens but I do think that if you take him back over nothing um and you're the one who's begging it's not going to be better for you ex wants to try again but says he's scared to try again what do I do ask him why he's scared see if he'll communicate try to be really open with it and make sure you're not defensive at all because that'll scare him away but yeah ask questions why is he scared what's going on see if you can communicate your way through it I block my ex after one month and a few days later he blocked me too he has a new girl a girlfriend meaning um so I would think probably Hannah that like he might have taken the sign that you blocked him as like a finality sign and then blocked you back and is trying someone new um if it's only a month and he's dating someone new I would think that it's like it's an interesting thing Sarah I do think that like it would probably be pretty reboundy meaning like he might be doing it just to get over the feeling of being with you um but that's why I I'm kind of different than a lot of people on what I think about blocking so if you're like g-money with what he said earlier and you're just focusing on moving on I think blocking is a fantastic option because you're not going to hear from them you're not going to see anything that'll cause conflict or anything like that the reason I hesitated to tell people to block if they are like working on repairing it is because stuff like this like I do think that it looks to the person like you don't want or have any desire to be back together with them which if there is like your goal is repairing the relationship they do need to kind of they need to be on the maybe side they need to not think they can have you back no matter what but they also don't want to feel like it's impossible they want to feel like they can maybe do it so yeah he's having doubts as well he wants to get back together because he feels like I always want to break up okay so this is also Liz ex luna I would why do you want to get back together like why do you think he'll be different like is any of this just anxiety about not being able to have him that's making you um should I unblock him yeah I think I would I think that's the best thing um but yeah okay um why did my ex randomly send me a tick tock at 3am after non-texting for a week definitely curiosity I would just like it do nothing else um crap I don't remember what I was talking about before that let's keep going maybe it'll come back no contact wasn't working for him he told me he is just really good at turning his emotions off hmm that's interesting so that is um that is what do I mean curiosity watch watch a video I post today I'll post it um at three so in like two hours about [Music] um it's it's called The Curiosity stage you can also go I'm remaking the the playlist today but you can go there's a playlist right now called stitches of breakup part two is that one but I'm making a better version right now but um I don't think people can shut their emotions off all the way so I think that he can shut his emotions off for a time but it doesn't work all the way you're still even if you're good at shutting your emotions off you're still a human and I want him back because we have a great connection but the only problem is that he can't be consistent so I do think that someone who really loves you would be consistent all the time because of work it's still a choice people are making like I do feel like that if you're not getting your needs met all the time like what are you expecting to happen I guess if you get back together with him do you think he'll quit his job or get a different one so that so that he'll be able to be consistent I do think you can have that connection with a lot of people I don't believe in soul mates um I do know that it's hard and I do know that you you hold on to hope and and feel like like if they just change this one thing then it would be perfect because we have all these good things but this one thing is like a deal breaker if that's the case like like is he actually gonna quit his job or change something about it or are you going to change your expectations um because if neither of those change then you'll probably get back together feel neglected and want to break up again and be sad so I'd be really honest about yourself for that kind of stuff he just tells me that he hadn't had a girlfriend for a long time so he sometimes doesn't know how to change yeah your needs are just as important as his if he's not being able to meet your needs and he's saying all these things that you need to work on maybe in time things will get better I yeah the more you say about it like I'm I'm more on the I'm more on the side of like keep working on yourself and attract someone that will be able to meet all of your needs because I promise you there's someone out there that will have just as deep of a connection but also be there for you there totally will be so I would think about that at least um if you do if you do go and talk and meet up with him I would get really I would still still even if you're trying to like re-attract him and you feel like if you're um like saying what your needs are will push him away good like you don't you don't want him if he's not able to meet all of your needs sorry that was pretty blunt but I think I think that would help my ex texts A girlfriend of mine why did she do that um that's pretty pretty clear sign that they're pretty curious on what's going on a lot of the time okay my ex cheating on me and never said anything after the breakup nothing wow I want one-on-one call with you write me how Okay Philip so what you need to do there's a link in my bio it's a link tree click on that there's three boxes you can click on the patreon the Discord and the top one is the calls it's called like let's make a plan or something like that click that one and then it brings you to my website and you can sign up for a time that works for you cool can you get over someone in two or three weeks after eight years of marriage no no you can't can get over someone while you're in the marriage though so you've got to think about that that's something that I learned like recently talking to people and also seeing my girlfriend do it she was married before and like yeah if they withdraw if they stop fighting you um can I do more videos on rebound relationships sure yeah I'm gonna make two more videos today so I'll make I'll make one on that um yeah they can move on during the relationship but if if they're if you don't think that happened and um yeah if you don't think that happened then two or three weeks is definitely not enough time to get over eight year marriage no way and it's gonna take probably I'd say like six months minimum or longer maybe even like a year that's so long to be with someone okay sweet Bentley Simcox new Patron okay awesome so join for Bentley if you're watching this join um the Facebook group and we can get on the live call today too it's gonna be in 10 minutes okay all right um so for Corinne Lee I don't understand actually this one's lies Luna one more time I don't understand why he doesn't put the same energy in me like he did before it's so fast I know it's hard to understand but you've got to be honest with yourself and and like treat yourself with enough respect that you don't expect you don't accept things that aren't good enough okay so Corinne said that she broke no contact and she feels dumb what does she do you're not dumb you're just all you did was give in to one of the strongest urges a person can have which is not losing a connection that's really important to you which that's like totally normal everyone does that so don't beat yourself up thing that I can do um or thing that you can do right now I think you feel better is join the Discord Shadow storm keeps posting in there it's also in the link in my bio you can click on the the bottom one in the link tree and it's just join it for free that's gonna give you people to talk to there are also no contacts you won't feel alone it's a lot easier to keep it if you have people that are going through the same thing that you can talk to in the moment because if you're feeling a big temptation to do it then you can go and talk to people it's going to be um easier but you're not stupid yeah same thing with you Luna you're not stupid okay is it a month and a half no contact too early to tell if we'll talk again it's a money um if she's messaging you know if you're messaging her yes I I think if you're gonna message her I would wait at least like three months I definitely think that she could still just be relieved if you're trying to contact her at that time okay hello my ex did not wish me on my birthday does that mean we're done for real not necessarily like it is a good sign if they do it on your birthday but again there's a lot more details like I never can say they're coming back for real or they're done for real um without like knowing anything so that's why we do the one-on-one calls um okay yummiest Bard are you Bruno did you change your name do you understand that you are showing respect for their space do they understand that you are showing respect for their space with no contact if I'm blocked yes yep I do that's why you've got to not go around the block um okay let's see Musa HS says she blocked me only on Instagram after one month of no contact what does that mean a lot of times okay cool good to know that Bruno um a lot of times oh shoot I just broke my highlighter damn let's stop messing with all my stuff when I talk a lot of times they can get kind of mad if you don't reach out to them which is fine like it's better that they get kind of mad than like that they're just bugged with you and annoyed with you so if that happens they can block you on more stuff but it pretty much just means that they're thinking about you so it's good so I I really wouldn't even consider that a bad thing if that happened what does it mean if ex if an ex asks to delete all messages in photos and that's a harder thing um I don't think you have to I do think it's best to like get Google photos or some Google Google photos or something um just because like it's best not to have all that on your phone just because it drives you crazy so I would get Google photos and delete all your pictures anyway and just put them on there so you still have them because you don't want to delete a whole entire picture of um yeah I think I would Hannah you don't have to like delete everything from your life like all these Pig parts of your life like if you're with someone for years and that's all those good memories you don't have to delete them from your whole life but I would put them on Google photos so that you don't have to um please call can you tell me the answer one more time please bad internet um can you type it again I kind of forgot what it was oh no I remember I remember yeah I will um but yeah that's what I would do there okay so for Bruno or now yummiest Bard um I I think what was the question if if you're blocked will they know that you're respecting their space yes they will still know that If You're Expecting their space similar to that um but you gotta be really careful not to go around the block because if you do not respect your their space and they've blocked you like there's a higher wall and you still get over it by making a fake account or emails or anything like that that's going to be worse than like not respecting their space if you're not blocked so never ever if you're blocked do anything always my wife left me three weeks ago she says she don't love me and is over me a few weeks after eight years together I'm sorry puga R35 GTR that is a cool car though um but okay anyway to tell if it's true that they moved on while in their relationship can't tell if she said she did Okay g money I'm gonna make that this week's video with Jocelyn talking because like um I might post that halfway through the week too maybe we'll do that because I don't think that one would be good for YouTube because I wouldn't want to like share her personal things um but I think just on the patreon to be good but um she's she's the one that showed me that people can move on while they're in a relationship and um yeah Bentley Bentley if you just join the patreon um look through the post there should be one that tells you to join a Facebook group like three back or something like that join the Facebook group in like four minutes there's gonna be like a live call um so do that so you're on it but um yeah g-money I'll I'll ask her because that's something that I'm kind of learning about still I don't totally know but she did so I think it'd be good to like have her tell us like why and how she did from what I've talked to her about so far um the things that I've seen where she actually like stopped fighting um at the end which I think is an interesting thing just because they kind of accept that they don't need to fight for anything anymore they don't need to fight for their relationship to be better so let's start stop fighting at the end as much as you used to so yeah okay we'll do a couple more so I'm Veronica actually let me see if the Discord I think there was something on there too let me make sure I did that I'll answer Veronica's too though okay so answer Charlie's in the Discord too but how do you get an expect that's not communicating with you so at the beginning you should not be communicating anyway that's totally normal um why is Luna probably that's not a good sign but um I still think it would be okay to talk and see what happens um but if they're not talking with you that's okay and that's normal that's how everyone is on here pretty much it's probably better honestly than like communicating over nothing so do no contact like we've talked about and that's what you should focus on right now but yes okay so Charlie on the Discord said that um his ex is scared thinking that he hasn't changed and he's struggling building trust again um their families are connected so they see each other every once in a while they still have a dog together she's scared because he would use her past against her because of his own insecurities so that's the trust that she lost so that is really tough I did that too um and it really hurts people so most of the time um I like that you've realized it's your own insecurities it's doing that so what I would focus on if I were you um if you're in here I hope you are I'll post this on YouTube though too so um for the people who want it on there but um if if you realize it's your own insecurities it's causing you to use your ex's past against them when you're in a relationship which it definitely is if you were doing that like past sexual history um nitpicking about little things like that which is what I used to do um like their movie taste or something stupid then it is because you're insecure that's why you're doing it 100 percent so do things to increase your own self-esteem usually you're insecure because you're not totally liking um oh cool book to time tomorrow one-on-one conversation with you how does it go what's up for Philip um I'll email you but basically what it is is it's a Google meet link which I'll send you five minutes before our time we planned so yeah okay um but back to this one so do things to make yourself more secure you really can a lot of times it's because you're not living the life you want to live all the way so if you hate your job get a different one if you hate where you live move if you hate your friends find new friends if you don't feel like you have any hobbies try new things that you think sound kind of cool even if it's just like a little bit of a desire follow it like I I wrestled in high school so I thought Jiu Jitsu would be cool and I like freaking love it I haven't done it a little bit because my shoulder's been hurt but um do those types of things also therapy is awesome but that's how I think I would build up trust she would be able to sense how you feel about yourself and I think that would help with that okay awesome so I'm gonna start the patreon one right now um but yeah we'll have a call on Tick Tock tomorrow as well I usually do Monday Wednesday Friday but it's gonna be Tuesday Wednesday Friday this time because I was snowmobiling yesterday so I'll see you guys on Tick Tock tomorrow if you want to be um in the patreon one join it really quick and you should be able to get in but if you just joined it join the Facebook thing and then you'll be able to get in okay I'll see you guys tomorrow though
if you just purchased this mini course then you probably feel horrible i advertised it so that people who just got broken up with would get it and that's kind of what i'm expecting right now so you probably can't eat or sleep you probably feel horrible and that if you could just get that person back then it would solve all of your problems in the world so that's all you want to do today we are going to talk about how to get them back more importantly we're going to talk about how to make you feel okay being yourself okay we're gonna try our best to accomplish both of those goals but i want you to know that the ultimate goal of this mini course and everything i do is to help you feel okay on your own because that's the place you can actually get people back and coming from that place is where you can be happy and stable in a relationship with someone new or your ex so that's our main goal with this course a little bit about me i'm not a therapist at all i love psychology but my background is in medicine so i did pre-med at brigham young university idaho and i'm applying for medical school right now i want to do ophthalmology the reason i do this is because of my life experience when i was 20 years old i got married and i was completely happy in the marriage i loved it i loved my wife and everything seemed to be going great but after two and a half years one day she came home and said that we were getting a divorce and for about three days i tried everything i could to fix it i cried i tried um arguing i tried being nice and nothing worked and within like a month it was final and i haven't seen her since then i have no idea where she is and then after that what i did is i just decided that i needed to rebuild my life exactly the way it was i just wanted to get another girl in it and another dog in another home so i got in another relationship really quickly without doing any grieving without learning much and it was great for a while it works well as a band-aid and i really loved that girl too and we actually almost got married but the same problems emerged again because i hadn't worked on anything which caused that relationship to end too and that's when i started looking into breakup psychology and relationship psychology and communication tips and that's when i started making these videos because my ultimate goal with them is to save you guys the pain that i've been through i want your relationships to be as happy as they possibly can be i want you to be as confident yourself as you possibly can be if that means that we get your ex back then awesome a lot of relationships are worth repairing and i think that some misunderstandings cause some beautiful relationships to end prematurely which they shouldn't so we should fix that or whether that means you don't and you move on and you become a really happy person on your own that's able to have a deeper relationship than you thought possible with someone new that could happen too and that's awesome too so that's our goal with this course today we're going to go through some principles on how you can best work on yourself how you can get them back with the eventual goal of you moving into a happier place of hope again whether that means you get them back or not our goal is that you have hope by the end of this and a plan so i want to start out by talking about the mindset you should have and the mindset that i believe is healthiest either way is to assume you will get another chance they've done some studies at colleges which show that about 65 percent of exes do reach out again and actually get back together they repair the relationship and that's without what we're gonna go over today that's with everyone begging sending handwritten letters going and doing grand gestures and that still gets about 65 so you have better odds than that but even if they don't come back even if you are meant to be with someone else if you work like this if you get ready for them to come back then you're going to win either way you're going to learn about attachment styles communication you're going to go to the gym make new friends and anyone who gets to date you in the future whether that's your ex or someone new is going to be extremely lucky to have someone who worked through all these things and learned about themselves your brain actually views the situation like this when humans were hunters and gatherers being part of the tribe was everything if you were alone in the woods like this guy then you'd be in danger from tigers and bears so we evolved to do everything we could to be able to stay with the tribe and not get abandoned when they left you you got abandoned so your brain is going to release chemicals like adrenaline and hold back serotonin and dopamine the chemicals that make you happy so you're motivated to do anything to get back into the tribe or to get back your girlfriend or wife or husband or boyfriend so that gives you two choices you can either go crazy with all those chemicals going in your head which you might be feeling like now or you can use that motivation to make yourself better to learn and become healthier and become the best version of yourself either to attract them back or to be healthier in the future so first we have to get the basics out of the way you have to be eating and sleeping so here's two ways that i used that made a little easier for me because i couldn't eat at all like i said before i would throw up if i just had a bite of an apple the easiest way to get calories in especially long-lasting calories are drinking protein shakes if you can't eat then try buying either premier protein or a different kind of protein shake that you can just slowly drink throughout the day smoothies do the same thing my background is more medical that's what i want to be as a doctor so i really like the science of the body and the easiest way to get better at sleep that you can actually control is controlling when light goes into your eyes so it controls a serotonin melatonin cycle but put it simply if you go on a walk or get outside really in the early in the morning like the first thing you do and then don't look at your phone at least an hour before you go to bed you're going to be able to sleep better so these are two simple things that you can apply today that are going to make it a lot easier for you to do what's coming up so we're now going to move into the best way you can get your ex or spouse back and again to preface this this is kind of the motivation we start with a lot of the time at the beginning right after a breakup you feel a lot of anxiety which makes you think i have to get this person back no matter what and you're kind of blinded to the things that were wrong in the relationship as time goes on you're naturally going to have a more clear mind and you'll be able to see if you really do want them back or not but some relationships really do have a lot of value and should be saved so this is going to be how we can save those but it's a good starting place for everyone no contact so you've probably seen this on youtube or from my videos this is the best way to get someone back and today we're going to go over why what it means in my definition is that you don't reach out to them so a lot of people say that you should ignore them if they text you i don't think that at all i think a basic definition is if they ask for space they broke up with you the ball is in their court so the most respectful and the most mature thing you can do is to not contact them to leave them alone let them have the consequences of the decision they made so that they can miss you and actually feel what it's like to be alive and live life without you in it so we're going to dive into the mind of your ex right now we're going to go through what they're thinking after a breakup so that you can see and be convinced that this really is the best way to get them back so for the next little bit we're going to think about the situation from your ex's perspective back to the tribe example this is a lot different from what you're experiencing so they're not going to feel the same way you're feeling right now from their point of view they left the tribe and it was their choice this person that left has 100 of the control okay nobody's leaving them they feel like they're doing what they want to do so the first thing they're going to feel in this case is relief and when you first hear that that they're relieved to be away from you it hurts a ton but it makes a ton of sense too okay so breakups don't happen on a whim usually they're thinking about it in their head battling with it in their mind if they're going to leave you or not for weeks or months so when they finally do it they don't feel relieved because you're gone really but because they did something that was really hard that's been bugging them for months and weeks okay so the best example that i like is cliff jumping i like to cliff jump a ton there's a lot of clip jumping here in utah and it's just a really really fun thing to do when you're up at the top it feels horrible okay especially if it's bigger than you've ever done so you sit up there and you think about it and you think about it and you think about it when you finally do it when you jump off let's get the legs off of there too when you jump off and you land down in the water down here you feel amazing you feel relieved because you did something that was really hard okay so what your ex is going to be doing during this time is they're going to be partying they're going to be having a lot of fun they're going to be posting on social media that they're having the best time of their lives but remember it has nothing to do with you okay it's because they did something that was really really hard now back to no contact if you are going to contact them at this point because you think you can win them back if you go over to their house or you write them a big long letter or you fly to their house if they're really far away if you do any of those big gestures it's like you're taking them out of this relieved state that they're in and putting them back up there in the uncomfortable state they're not going to want to do that okay so if you contact them which you you probably have already done and you've probably seen this but if you keep contacting them they'll start off nice but eventually they're going to get cold and then after that they're going to get mean and hateful which you don't want to see that will hurt so much more than just not hearing from them so this stage usually lasts like a week to a couple months based on how long the relationship is why it ended and what you did because if you are this guy if you're taking them and putting them back in the uncomfortable situation you're trying to force them and manipulate them into being back with you they're going to try their hardest to stay relieved as long as they can so if you want this pain to end then you need to leave them be and let them be relieved for a while again it usually lasts a week to a couple months so if you're respectful of that and you do give them that week or a couple months they're gonna get a little bit curious and that's the next stage now the reason is subconsciously in their head if they left you they assume that they're more attractive or better than you in some way that's just kind of the natural psychology of what happens when you dump someone you did it because there's something better for you out there now the natural role of you the person who got dumped is to reach out to them because again a less attractive person is supposed to chase the more attractive person so if you're not doing that then they're going to be kind of confused and they'll get curious now this manifests in them watching your stories on instagram okay or things like that asking your family members or your friends how you're doing if you're dating anyone they're going to start to snoop around a little bit you don't want to contact them again here if you do they have no more mystery no more curiosity and they'll just go back into relief so you need to stay strong at this point but look for those signs to keep yourself motivated to continue so if they're curious for a while and they're not getting the information they want they're going to transition into being concerned and this is where the control shifts more into your cord okay so this whole time they had every decision they had no anxiety you had all the anxiety at this point it starts to switch over they start to feel a little bit more like you've been feeling which is what eventually drives them to reach out but this word is the most important everything you do on social media everything they see and hear should be pointed at this word that they might be able to get you back okay so if you're just going out to lots of clubs and you're posting pictures of other guys or other girls to make them jealous this word's not gonna be there they're gonna feel like i can't get them back they're with all these other people so i'm not even going to try that's not what you want so you want to post that you're happy that you're with your family and your friends and that way there's a lot of hope but you haven't reached out yet you haven't done your natural role of chasing after them when they left you so they're also not sure if they can get you back so they're stuck at this might but it eventually drives them to reach out in most cases when they do eventually reach out it's going to be something like this okay so again they're going to be afraid that you might reject them so they're not just going to come out in most cases and say i miss you let's get back together they're going to test the waters a little bit you need to stay open to it but reserved and keep your interest level below theirs now what that means is that if they're texting you and asking all the questions make sure you don't ask more questions than them make sure that they are the ones leading the conversation and if it starts to fizzle out let it fizzle let them keep coming to you but this is how they usually do it so how are you how's your day or they ask something that they can easily get the answer from google or anyone else like do you know any fun things to do in denmark like maybe you went on vacation there one time but they could google it they're doing these kind of things because they want to test the waters and see if they can repair it with you because a part of them wants to so that's what we're shooting for with no contact that's why it's worth it it hurts it's super super hard because you feel like you're doing nothing you feel like you have no control but it naturally pushes them through those stages and that's your best bet okay so we're going to talk about now what you can do while you're waiting because again that waiting and that time is part of the experience it's one of the main ingredients is time because they need time to go through that process and go through those stages and if you do do nothing if you just sit there and then they reach out and you're the same person the relationship's gonna end the same way so you need to use this time those brain chemicals and that motivation to change so one of the beginning steps that i recommend to pretty much everyone is learning about attachment styles so we're going to go over a basic overview of them right now and if one of these sounds like you then you should do a deep dive into that so all of attachment theory started with an experiment in the 1970s by a scientist named mary ainsworth called the strange situation experiment now in this experiment they put a baby their mom and a researcher in a room with a lot of toys they played for a little bit and then they had the mom leave and they tracked how the baby reacted and it was really interesting because the babies reacted in three consistent ways the first group of babies were what's called secure when the mom left they cried they were sad but after a second they sued themselves they started playing with the toys again they kind of got back to what they were doing and then when the mom came back they were extremely happy when they saw her they gave her a hug and then they went back to playing with their toys like nothing happened they trusted their mom the second group of babies was a little more interesting they're called the anxiously attached babies and that's what i think i had and have to work through but they cried same as the secure when the mom left but they didn't sue themselves they didn't start playing with the toys again they were just completely sad until the mom came back but they reacted differently then too they weren't happy when she came back they were angry at her for leaving now the last group of babies i think is the most interesting they're called the avoidant babies and when the mom left they didn't react they just kept doing their same thing when she came back they didn't react either those are the avoidant babies now the reason that study's meaningful for you because you're not a baby anymore is because all of these things stick with us throughout our entire lives and most importantly this is how we attach to our significant others this is how we act in romantic relationships so as adults a secure person is going to be able to be in relationships long term they're comfortable with intimacy whether someone's getting too close or if they're kind of distancing themselves they have confidence in their partner they don't pick little fights and they're okay they have long lasting relationships this is where we all want to be anxious people kind of like the babies are always afraid that their partner is going to leave they'll be nitpicky they'll look for little tiny flaws little tiny things that can cause the relationship to end and they'll focus on that which often times starts fights makes the other partner feel pressured and can end relationships which is what happened to me in both of mine okay these people are also not very comfortable outside of relationships so if you find yourself continually bouncing from relationship to relationship that could be why and learning how to be alone is a valuable way and a valuable path to move into security and the last one avoidant people they're the ones who are the most common in the dating pool so if you do end up being one of those who doesn't get their ex back and you go back to dating it's good to know about these people because you're gonna date some of them those kind of people aren't comfortable with intimacy when you get too close they push you away and they often just leave the relationship because they start to feel smothered okay so these develop in early childhood if your parents consistently met your needs most of the time they fed you they gave you attention everything you thought you needed when you were a little kid before the age of three usually you become secure if your parents had to do other things that they were busy some of the time but really tried hard other times so they were inconsistent in meeting your needs you developed anxiously and if someone deeply hurt you when you were young you completely trusted them and you got completely let down you develop a hard shell and that's what avoidance are that they're afraid of being let down again in their romantic relationship so if anyone gets too close and might break that shell they don't let them in they run away the amazing thing is that even though they were developed in childhood and you've had it your whole life these different attachment styles they're plastic which means that if you actually work through it if you go to therapy or if you read which this by the way is my favorite resource on it it's a book called attached it goes through how to become more secure if you do work like that you can move in to security whether you're anxious or avoidant and that is what i think you should focus on now okay so you're feeling extremely anxious you're feeling really hurt this motivation to move into someone who can deal better with anyone in relationships use that motivation to become that kind of person okay again you can do this book also if you want to sign up for my email newsletter once a week i send out an email on how to move more into security things that have worked for me because again i started out um kind of anxious after my last breakup and i've done some things to move past that and to become more secure i don't feel like i'm perfect right now but i do feel like i'm a lot better and i enjoy being alone which used to be very hard for me but while you're here i do want to share one thing that you can do today that's going to help you whether you're avoidant or anxious move into more security and i wanted to share this one in this video in this course because it's general and it'll apply to all of you so either way if you are anxious or if you're avoidant it all boils down to a fear of abandonment okay so it's just different ways of dealing with it both people are afraid that they're going to get left so avoidant people don't let anyone in they don't let anyone leave them because no one gets close enough to hurt them anxious people they hold on tight and say you're not allowed to leave me and if there's all these things we've got to figure out first we're going to just go through them all now in your face and you're going to feel pressured so that you don't leave me so both of them if you fix that fear of abandonment if you can convince yourself that you're not worth abandoning then you're going to be more secure so this is what's worked for me affirmations okay so basically what an affirmation is is just something that you repeat every day that changes how you think about yourself it has to do with the science and psychology of the subconscious mind you're in your subconscious you have what's called your self-image and that self-image is just made up of everything you hear about yourself everything you think everything you say and everything that other people say about you and it takes all those pieces of information and puts them into one hole and that's who you are and you act with everyone based on that foundation so if you believe that you're attractive then you're gonna live like that but if you've had like lots of thoughts that saying you're not attractive you're not smart then you're gonna believe you're that way and you're not going to be okay the cool thing about this is is that you can hack it you see your subconscious it doesn't put different value on what it hears or what you say or what you think they're all just one-on-one pieces of information so if you overload the positive thoughts then you're going to change the whole thing into positivity so it's not just positive thinking it's actually science of convincing yourself that you are not worth abandoning and if you can convince yourself then you're not gonna be abandoned because you'll act like someone who doesn't get abandoned okay so what i do and what i recommend you start doing today especially if you just got broken up with because that's a giant sign to your subconscious that you are worth abandoning that you have to overcome okay but you can do it so what i recommend doing is get those three by five note cards and then write down things like this is what i did i am the star of my own movie i am worthy of love and belonging it is natural for me to be loved i am 100 complete and whole on my own right now i am not worth abandoning okay so write those down on those note cards or write them down on your phone or make it your screensaver just something that you can look at i recommend three to five times a day repeat those to yourself eventually you'll have them memorized and the cool thing is you eventually just have them running in the back of your head like you know how you have thoughts that are just always going in your head for me those became the thoughts that were in my head you are worthy of love and belonging you are 100 complete right now and it feels really good to just on autopilot be complimenting yourself like that and when you do that you really do start to believe those things about yourself and that changes everything so what else can you do while you're waiting while you're becoming better during this time of no contact you already know these things but i'm just going to reiterate them here go to the gym it makes you look better which raises your chances of getting them back or someone else that's better makes you feel better releases dopamine and endorphins that actually like make your brain feel happy so that's worth it new friends or old friends make your life as enjoyable as possible by strengthening those relationships for me when my girlfriend left i didn't have any friends because i focused all of my attention on her okay so when she was gone i had nothing left so i had to go and i had to build all these new friendships and when i did as i built more of those relationships in my life i felt happier and i felt like that whole was being filled by other people that's what can happen for you too next thing travel i'm going to iceland in a week and it's amazing what you can do and everyone has the funds but if you just travel like around your neighborhood just experiencing new things will help you move through the grief process don't let all of your good memories be with that person make new ones hobbies passions that's one of the most attractive things you can do if you post on your story that you're out doing something like fishing or something that brings you joy it's going to be more attractive to them to want to come back it shows that you're not just sitting there thinking about them and crying but that you're out enjoying your life because you're a lot more attractive if you are enjoying your life people want to be in a life that's already fun okay so that's that's the goal of all of these you already know these things but that's why you're doing them you're doing them to become a better person and enjoy your own life on your own because that's when you can bring someone else into it either back into it or a new person and they're actually going to enjoy being in it okay now i have one more clip for you before we close on this and i recommend that you go back and you watch this a couple times take notes because it's a lot of things we've gone through with what they're thinking after what your mindset should be what attachment styles are the science behind all of it so i think it's worth kind of going through a couple times so you actually get all of it okay the last thing i wanted to share is when you do feel sad a lot of the things that we talked about a second ago may feel like distractions and i think that's good to distract yourself sometimes it's good to go to the gym if you feel horrible but it is also really valuable to actually feel your emotions to emotions work by kind of being signals that something's wrong and there's something you have to get through it's kind of like when you have like when you touch a hot pan and it feels like pain you need to get your hand away that's the signal they need to do that so when you are feeling sad and you don't want to distract yourself it's good to sit in it it's good to sit there and feel what it feels like say i'm feeling sad and then just wait and just wait until it goes away cry listen to sad music the more you do that the faster the process is going to be and also the lower your anxiety level is going to be so that you can see clearly if you actually do want them back because again like i said at the beginning some relationships are meant to get back and some aren't right when a breakup happens it feels like every relationship is supposed to get back together but some really aren't and as you do this as you sit in your emotions as you truly feel through the situation which it's gonna come in waves you'll feel fine for a little bit and then you'll hear a song that you used to listen to with them and you cry or you'll see a place or you'll eat food or you'll see a movie and you'll cry and that's completely normal your brain has to get through all of those steps before you can be fine being on your own but you'll get there so i'm including with this video a simple test to try and see like a self-assessment to see what kind of attachment style you have so you can get resources on it and figure out how you can move more into security so i recommend that you do that as soon as you can okay if you need any personal help with your situation because even though these are the general things that people go through every situation is specific i do coaching calls and also emails on my website same place you got this course so if you want to do that go for it i'd love to meet you guys and i'd love to help but for now assume that you're going to have another chance most people do i know you feel like your ex is the special one that's not going to reach out but every single person tells me that and it's unreachable okay assume you're going to do it and that should be your motivation to get better over time it can change but let that work right now because a lot of you will have them reach out and if you don't apply these things we learned today you're not going to be ready you're going to lose it and it's going to hurt twice as bad okay so these things are valuable and they're true thank you guys so much for watching this and i'm really glad that we built this community and that you guys can be part of it but again call me if you need any help and i hope that you have a great day bye"
